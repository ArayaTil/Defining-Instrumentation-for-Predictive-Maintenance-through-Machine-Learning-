# Quantifying Cooler Efficiency for Predictive Maintenance
This is an application of machine learning to explore and potentially identify instrumentation(s) that 
can quantify/predict the efficicency of a cooler on a hydraulic rig with minimal error. The hydraulic rig, 
equipped with redundant instrumentation, was setup for a test run under different load conditions. Different levels of
faults were introduced to the four components of the rig under different combinational scenarios to collect
data at various points on the rig. The collected data was shared online at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/,
“Condition Monitoring of Hydraulic Systems”.

Please refer to the related article and python code for details.
